# conelang
conelang is a minimalist esoteric programming language written in pure assembly language for fun. It is heavily inspired by concatenative and stack-oriented languages.

# Building
In order to compile conelang, you will only need nasm and ld. This interpreter is written for x86\_64 linux, so you cannot use it natively on other platforms.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/hackers-pr/conelang.git
cd conelang
make build
```
